# CodeAcross 2016 Sponsorship Prospectus

## What is Open Austin?
Open Austin is a volunteer citizen brigade advocating for open government, open data, and civic application development since 2009. Open Austin is an official brigade affiliated with the nonprofit Code for America which believes government can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century. As a part of a national movement we design & build open source technology and organize a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use.

## What is CodeAcross?
CodeAcross is a weekend of civic hacking events hosted by groups like Open Austin throughout the world.  The goal of CodeAcross is to activate the civic tech network and inspire residents everywhere to get actively involved in their communities. Though the title of this event is “CodeAcross" to align with national events under the Code for America umbrella, we plan for this event to be focused on design thinking that is foundational to future project work which may or may not include “coding” projects.

## Learn About CodeAcross in Austin
This year, Open Austin will host an event to bring together nonprofit leaders, policy experts, civil servants, urbanists, community organizers, designers, developers, data scientists, and anyone with a passion to make our city better. The event will be free to attend. Participants will brainstorm, discuss and collaborate on problems that affect Austin residents. The event will revolve around a facilitated workshop that utilizes human-centered design principles and agile design sprints. 

### Key results include: 
- Fully scoped problem statements with clear actionable follow-up tasks. These problem statements will move will move along as projects in our year long arc of "civic hacking" with continued work at ATX Hack for Change hosted by St. Edward's University partnering with the City of Austin and Open Austin. 
- Foster dialogue between disparate networks in Austin including nonprofits, government staff, social good startups, and community organizations like Open Austin.
- An interactive and enjoyable introduction to the problem solving in the spirit of civic hacking
